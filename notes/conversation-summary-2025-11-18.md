Conversation summary — Migration to provider-agnostic domain manager
Date: 2025-11-18

Summary:

- Converted the OpenSRS-only WordPress plugin into a provider-agnostic domain manager.
- Added NameCheap integration (`includes/class-namecheap-api.php`) and a provider facade (`includes/class-domain-provider.php`).
- Ported plugin-level helpers into `includes/class-domain-manager-*.php` files (settings, checkout, product-type, importer, pricing, renewals).
- Added per-product provider selection UI and a connection tester in settings.
- Implemented NameCheap-specific contact validation in the checkout flow using `wu_setup_checkout` hook.
- Archived legacy `class-opensrs-*` helper files into `archive/includes/` to avoid duplicates and preserve history.
- Added developer tooling: `dev-check.ps1` (local syntax/brace check) and GitHub Actions `.github/workflows/php-lint.yml` for CI.
- Prepared release draft and helper: `RELEASE_DRAFT_MIGRATION_2025-11-18.md`, `RELEASE_BODY_FOR_GITHUB.md`, and `scripts/create-release.ps1`.

Outstanding actions (user):

- Run local lint (after reboot if necessary):

  Powershell (run from repository root):

  ```powershell
  .\dev-check.ps1
  # or, if you prefer raw PHP CLI checks:
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter '*.php' | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }
  ```

- If lint passes, create and push the release (examples):

  ```powershell
  # using the helper (requires gh CLI and authenticated session)
  .\scripts\create-release.ps1 -Version "vX.Y.Z" -BodyPath .\RELEASE_BODY_FOR_GITHUB.md

  # or manually
  git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Migration to provider-agnostic domain manager"
  git push origin vX.Y.Z
  gh release create vX.Y.Z --draft --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file .\RELEASE_BODY_FOR_GITHUB.md
  ```

- Test on staging: TLD import, connection test for both providers, checkout registration (NameCheap special contact validation), renewals/auto-renew flows.

Notes/Where to look in repo:

- `wu-opensrs-domain-manager.php` — plugin bootstrap and includes wiring.
- `includes/class-domain-manager-*.php` — provider-agnostic helpers (settings, checkout, pricing, renewals, importer, product-type).
- `includes/class-opensrs-api.php` — OpenSRS provider API (unchanged provider-specific file).
- `includes/class-namecheap-api.php` — NameCheap provider API wrapper.
- `archive/includes/` — archived original `class-opensrs-*` helpers.
- `dev-check.ps1` — local check script (powershell).
- `.github/workflows/php-lint.yml` — CI php -l checks.

If anything here needs more detail or you want this saved as a different filename or format, tell me which path and I will update it.

I can also commit the file for you (create a commit/tag and push) if you want — confirm and I'll run the commands to create a local commit and push.
