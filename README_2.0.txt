# 🚀 Reseller Panel v2.0 - Ready for Production

## What You Need to Know

Your Reseller Panel plugin has been **completely rebuilt** from the ground up following Ultimate Multisite (WP Ultimo) addon standards. This is a **major upgrade** with proper architecture for scaling and future growth.

## The Problem (Solved) ✅

1. **Menu wasn't showing** → Fixed by registering under correct `wp-ultimo` parent menu
2. **Settings weren't saving** → Fixed by implementing proper config management via site options
3. **Text domain inconsistency** → Fixed by standardizing to `ultimate-multisite`
4. **No fallback logic** → Implemented intelligent provider routing with admin notifications
5. **Hard to expand** → Created provider interface system for infinite extensibility

## What's New

### Architecture
- **Service Provider Interface** - Every provider follows same contract
- **Base Service Provider** - Common functionality all providers inherit
- **Provider Manager** - Factory pattern for managing multiple providers
- **Service Router** - Intelligent request routing with automatic fallback
- **Admin Pages** - Professional UI matching Ultimate Multisite design

### Built-in Providers
1. **OpenSRS (TuCows)**
   - Domain registration/management
   - TLD listing and pricing sync
   - XML-RPC API integration

2. **NameCheap**
   - Domains, SSL, Hosting, Emails
   - Multi-service support
   - Admin price overrides
   - XML API integration

### Key Features
✅ **Fallback Routing** - Automatic provider failover without customer impact
✅ **Admin Notifications** - Email alerts when primary provider fails
✅ **Audit Logging** - Track all fallback events
✅ **Service Configuration** - Enable/disable services per site
✅ **Provider Management** - Easy credential setup with test connection
✅ **Responsive UI** - Professional admin interface matching UMS design
✅ **Fully Documented** - Complete architecture guide included

## Files to Know About

### Three Documentation Files
1. **QUICK_START.md** - Start here! Step-by-step setup guide
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical deep dive for developers
3. **RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md** - What changed and why

### New Plugin Structure
```
reseller-panel.php (main file - kept here for UMS compatibility)
inc/                (addon code)
├── class-reseller-panel.php (core addon class)
├── class-provider-manager.php (provider factory)
├── class-service-router.php (fallback routing)
├── interfaces/ (provider contract)
├── abstract/ (shared provider code)
├── providers/ (OpenSRS, NameCheap implementations)
└── admin-pages/ (settings UI)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Installation ✅
```
1. Go to Ultimate Multisite network admin
2. Look for "Reseller Panel" in the main menu (under WordPress Ultimo)
3. You should see three sub-pages
```

### 2. Quick Setup (5 minutes)
```
1. Go to Reseller Panel → Provider Settings
2. Click "OpenSRS" tab
3. Enter your API credentials
4. Click "Test Connection" (should pass)
5. Go to Services Settings
6. Enable "Domains" service
7. Select "OpenSRS" as default provider
8. Done! ✓
```

### 3. Test It Works
```
In your code:
$router = \Reseller_Panel\Service_Router::get_instance();
$result = $router->execute_service('domains', 'register', ['domain' => 'example.com']);
```

## Configuration

### Where Settings Are Stored
- **Database:** WordPress site options (network-wide)
- **Table:** `wp_reseller_panel_services` and `wp_reseller_panel_providers`
- **Config:** JSON in option values (one per provider)

### Default Services Available
- Domains
- SSL Certificates
- Hosting
- Email Services
- Marketing (placeholder for future)

### Admin Pages
1. **Reseller Panel** (Dashboard/Overview)
2. **Services Settings** (Enable services, select providers)
3. **Provider Settings** (Configure API credentials)

All under network admin menu.

## Adding More Providers

Want to add Dynadot, GoDaddy, or another provider?

```php
// 1. Create class in inc/providers/class-provider-name.php
class Custom_Provider extends Base_Service_Provider {
    protected $key = 'customname';
    protected $supported_services = ['domains', 'ssl'];
    // Implement required methods...
}

// 2. Register in inc/class-reseller-panel.php load_dependencies()
require_once RESELLER_PANEL_PATH . 'inc/providers/class-custom-provider.php';

// 3. Auto-register in Provider_Manager constructor
$this->register_provider( new Custom_Provider() );

// 4. It appears automatically in admin!
```

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete provider development guide.

## API Reference

### Get Available Providers
```php
$manager = \Reseller_Panel\Provider_Manager::get_instance();
$providers = $manager->get_available_providers('domains');
```

### Execute Service (with fallback)
```php
$router = \Reseller_Panel\Service_Router::get_instance();
$result = $router->execute_service('domains', 'action', $params);

if (is_wp_error($result)) {
    echo "Failed: " . $result->get_error_message();
}
```

### Get Fallback Logs
```php
$router = \Reseller_Panel\Service_Router::get_instance();
$logs = $router->get_fallback_logs(50);

foreach ($logs as $log) {
    echo $log->primary_provider . " failed, used " . $log->fallback_provider;
}
```

## Fallback In Action

When a domain is registered:

```
1. Try OpenSRS → Success? Done ✓
   
   If fails:

2. Try NameCheap → Success? Done ✓
   
   If fails:

3. Return error, send admin email
```

**Result:** Zero customer-visible downtime when primary provider has issues!

## Troubleshooting

### Menu not showing?
- Verify plugin is **Network Activated** (not single-site)
- Verify you're in **Network Admin** (not single site admin)
- Clear browser cache

### Settings not saving?
- Verify you have **manage_network** capability
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure you clicked the **Save** button

### Connection test fails?
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Try Sandbox environment first
- Check with provider (API key might need activation)

See **QUICK_START.md** for more troubleshooting.

## What Changed From Old Version

### Before (Old Structure)
```
❌ Wu_OpenSRS_Addon class in main file
❌ Domain_Manager files scattered
❌ No provider abstraction
❌ Hard-coded single provider logic
❌ Text domain inconsistencies
❌ Menu not registering
```

### After (New Structure)
```
✅ Proper UMS addon architecture
✅ Organized inc/ directory structure  
✅ Service_Provider_Interface pattern
✅ Provider_Manager factory
✅ Service_Router with fallback
✅ Consistent text domain
✅ Menu correctly registered
```

## Performance Notes

- **Database:** Minimal overhead (config loaded once per request)
- **API Calls:** Only made when service executed (not on every page load)
- **Fallback:** Only kicks in if primary provider fails
- **Email:** Sent asynchronously where possible

## Security

- ✅ All forms include nonce verification
- ✅ All output properly escaped
- ✅ API keys stored in database (not logs)
- ✅ Network-wide settings (not user-specific)
- ✅ Capability checking on all admin pages
