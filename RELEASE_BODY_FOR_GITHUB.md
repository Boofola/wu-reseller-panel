Domain Manager — Migration release (Provider-agnostic + NameCheap)

Release date: 2025-11-18

Summary
- Migration to a provider-agnostic architecture; added NameCheap provider support.
- Renamed plugin-level includes from `class-opensrs-*` to `class-domain-manager-*`.
- Added per-product provider selection, provider connection tester, provider-aware checkout validation, and improved renewals handling.
- Added CI linting (`.github/workflows/php-lint.yml`) and a local `dev-check.ps1` helper.

Details
- Provider facade: `includes/class-domain-provider.php` routes domain operations to either OpenSRS or NameCheap.
- Provider API wrappers: `includes/class-opensrs-api.php` and `includes/class-namecheap-api.php` (provider-specific).
- Plugin-level helpers (migrated from `class-opensrs-*`):
  - `includes/class-domain-manager-settings.php`
  - `includes/class-domain-manager-product-type.php`
  - `includes/class-domain-manager-domain-importer.php`
  - `includes/class-domain-manager-pricing.php`
  - `includes/class-domain-manager-renewals.php`
  - `includes/class-domain-manager-checkout.php`

Upgrade notes
- Legacy helper files were archived to `archive/includes/` — no action needed if you have backups.
- Test on staging: verify provider connections, TLD import, product settings, and checkout flows (especially NameCheap contact validation).
